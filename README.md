# mays-lost-property

A github pages site for getting in contact about my lost property

## The problem:

I am constantly loosing items I own, I have experimented with [Tile](https://www.tile.com/en-gb) which works but is too expensive to use on most things I own. I often rely on good samaritans to return items to lost property, but if something has fallen out of my pocket and onto the street there is nowhere to hand it in.

## The idea:

- Create stickers that contain a qr code that links to this page and stick them on just about everything I own
- Have the site contain an explination followed by an email address to contact me

## Technologies:

- Typescript
- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
